        'The purpose of this chapter is to understand the concept and purpose of Business Justification as it relates to Scrum projects. It is important for an organization to perform a proper business justification and create a viable Project Vision Statement prior to starting any project. This helps key decision makers understand the business need for a change or for a new product or service and the justification for moving forward with a project. It also helps the Product Owner to create a Prioritized Product Backlog along with the business expectations of Senior Management & Stakeholder(s).',
        'Business Justification, as defined in A Guide to the Scrum Body of Knowledge (SBOK™ Guide), is applicable to the following:',
        '•	Portfolios, programs, and/or projects in any industry',
        '•	Products, services, or any other results to be delivered to stakeholders',
        '•	Projects of any size or complexity',
        'The term “product” in the SBOK™ Guide may refer to a product, service, or other deliverables. Scrum can be applied effectively to any project in any industry—from small projects or teams with as few as six team members to large, complex projects with up to several hundred team members.'
